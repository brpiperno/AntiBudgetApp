# AntiBudgetApp
Native Android App intended to help users view their budgets at a high level, see how their spending habits change historically, and plan for the future. Written with Kotlin and JetPack Compose on the front end, and Java in the back end.


The Antibudget App is intended to be the opposite of traditional budgeting workflows. Rather than counting and sorting all transactions that occur on a day to day basis, the focus is on establishing pathways for the user to "pay themself first". That could mean setting up separate accounts for savings, investments, emergency funds, and checkings. As long as there are reoccuring transactions to move funds as expected, and the overall balances are tracked, the user does not need to meddle in reviewing each transaction. They can instead focus on analyzing their budget, making changes, reviewing the history of their budget details, and check their savings against their retirement plans.
